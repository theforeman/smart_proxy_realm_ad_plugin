# Description
This plugin adds a new realm provider for managing hosts in Active Directory.

Useful if you directly integrate with Active Directory and dont use FreeIPA. 

If you use this plugin you let foreman-proxy provision/deprovision computer accounts and password and also distribute the password to a kickstart file.

It does the following:

  * When hosts are created in foreman it will create a new computer account in active directory
    and return the password to foreman so it can be used in the kickstart file.
    
  * When hosts are rebuilt it will reset the computers account and return a new password to the kickstart file.

  * When hosts are deleted in foreman it will delete the associated computer account in active directory.
  
# Installation
